Some important tips for getting the RealityGrid QT Launcher application built and running.

* Environment - make sure these are set
  - REG_STEER_HOME to your RealityGrid Steering Library home
  - SSH to 0
  - QTDIR to wherever your QT version 3.1 is installed

* Dirs and links
  - make sure a 'tmp' directory exists in the top level dir (where this file is)

* Libs
  - make sure libxml2 is avaiable on the system you're running / building on.

* Configuration
  - the 'default.conf' file in the top level dir holds the GSH of the top level registry, plus lists of target machines and containers. Edit at will.

* Input files
  - you will need whatever input files that job is going to require

* Scripts
  - if you're adding a new application to be launched you'll need to create an
    <name>_launch.sh script in the scripts directory.  Have a look at the others
    for guidance.

Good Luck!
