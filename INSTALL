Some important tips for getting the RealityGrid QT Launcher application built and running.

* Environment - make sure these are set
  - REG_STEER_HOME to your RealityGrid Steering Library home
  - SSH to 0
  - QTDIR to wherever your QT version 3.1 is installed

* Dirs and links
  - make sure a 'tmp' directory exists in the top level dir (where this file is)
  - make sure that there is a symbolic link 'OGSI' in the scripts dir to wherever your OGSI-Lite/OGSI directory lives.

* Libs
  - make sure libxml2 is avaiable on the system you're running / building on.

* Configuration
  - the 'default.conf' file in the top level dir holds the GSH of the top level registry, plus lists of target machines and containers. Edit at will.

* Input files
  - the 'input-file-mark' & 'input-file-mark32' are the best input files to use (I should in fact remove the others....)

Good Luck!
