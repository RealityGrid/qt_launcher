RealityGrid QT Launcher Application

QT's 'Designer' software is used to design the GUI layout for the ReG launcher. This enables rapid prototyping to be employed, as well as offering the developer the benefit of a more intuitive design methodology (gui drag and drop style development, as opposed to pure text based!).

The knock on effect of this design choice is in the code tree, which has a 'ui' directory in addition to the standard 'src' and 'include' directories. This contains the high-level gui definition files produced by Designer, as well as accompanying ui-header files (*.ui.h), which contain actual code. A decision was made to keep these header files in the same directory as the a *.ui files, since the two exists in pairs, and not the standard c/c++ header/instance files.

The reg_qt_launcher.pro file is the project file produced and used by Designer. QMake will accept this as an input, and use it to generate the system Makefile.

So, the build process is simply:

qmake reg_qt_launcher.pro
make

Note - *.ui files and their accompanying headers are automatically converted into c++ classes, contained in the .ui/ directory. These are automatically generated files - and should therefore contain no user code. Any changes made to those files is wiped during the build process.



****

In short - non top level gui code lives in the src & include dirs, gui code lives in the ui dir (but in the *.ui.h files (!)).
